# 404 Page Fix Instructions

We've implemented several solutions to fix the 404 error issue on your Vercel deployment. Follow these steps to deploy the changes:

## What's Been Fixed

1. **Updated vercel.json** with proper routing configuration and file system handling
2. **Added a catch-all route** at `not-a-label/frontend/src/app/[...not_found]/page.tsx`  
3. **Added a fallback 404 page** at `not-a-label/frontend/src/pages/404.js`

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy through Vercel Dashboard

1. Log into the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Go to your Not-a-Label project
3. Click on the "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment or create a new deployment

### Option 2: Deploy using Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed):
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Log in to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy from your project root:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

### Option 3: Push to GitHub (if repository exists)

If you successfully connected your GitHub repository with Vercel:

1. Push the changes to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Create a pull request and merge to main
3. Vercel will automatically deploy the changes

## Verify the Fix

After deployment, test your site by navigating to a non-existent page, such as:
```
https://not-a-label.art/this-page-does-not-exist
```

You should now see the custom 404 page instead of an error.

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing the 404 issue:

1. Check that your DNS records are correctly configured
2. Ensure that your project settings in Vercel point to the correct framework and build directory
3. Try adding a `static/404.html` file as an additional fallback

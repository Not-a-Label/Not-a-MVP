# Not a Label MVP: Vision, Roadmap & Technical Architecture

## Executive Summary

Not a Label is a platform designed to empower independent musicians with tools traditionally reserved for signed artists. The MVP focuses on three core capabilities:

1. **Artist Profiles** - Customizable public pages for musicians to showcase their work
2. **Analytics Dashboard** - Data aggregation from multiple platforms to provide actionable insights
3. **AI Assistant** - Conversational guidance for career development and marketing strategy

Our approach follows the "Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable" product development philosophy, focusing on delivering incremental value rather than a feature-complete but delayed solution.

## Current Status: Walking Skeleton Implementation

We've successfully deployed a functional Walking Skeleton (a minimal end-to-end implementation) that includes:

- **Frontend** (Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind)
  - Public homepage with basic layout
  - Placeholder dashboard UI components
  - Working AI chat interface wired to backend API
  - Deployed to Vercel with custom domain (not-a-label.art)

- **Backend** (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
  - Authentication routes (register/login)
  - Skeleton API endpoints for profiles, analytics, and AI
  - PostgreSQL database connection setup
  - Environment configuration

This Walking Skeleton provides a foundation we can iteratively enhance, allowing us to gather feedback early while ensuring our architecture is sound.

## Core Value Proposition

Not a Label addresses a critical gap in the music industry:

- **For Artists**: Consolidates fragmented data from streaming, social media, and marketing channels into actionable insights
- **For Fans**: Provides direct discovery and connection to independent artists they love
- **For the Industry**: Creates transparency and levels the playing field for talent regardless of label backing

## Development Philosophy

Our development approach is inspired by both the Walking Skeleton and the Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable concepts:

1. **Start Small, Learn Fast**: Rather than building the entire car at once, we're starting with a skateboard - a minimal version that delivers the core value proposition.

2. **Iterative Enhancement**: Each development cycle will build on previous learnings and enhance the product incrementally, moving from skateboard to scooter to bicycle to motorcycle to car.

3. **User-Centered Development**: We prioritize features based on actual user needs rather than assumptions, using real feedback to guide our roadmap.

4. **Technical Excellence**: While moving quickly, we maintain a focus on scalable architecture, security, and maintainable code to support future growth.

## Product Development Stages

### Stage 1: Earliest Testable Product (Current)
- Basic artist profile creation and viewing
- Simple authentication system
- Placeholder analytics with sample data
- Basic AI assistant with limited capabilities
- Infrastructure and deployment pipelines

### Stage 2: Earliest Usable Product
- Enhanced artist profiles with customization options
- Integration with at least one streaming platform (e.g., Spotify)
- Initial analytics dashboard with real data
- Improved AI assistant with music industry knowledge
- Fan accounts with basic following capability

### Stage 3: Earliest Lovable Product
- Rich artist profiles with media embedding
- Multi-platform analytics integration (Spotify, YouTube, Instagram, etc.)
- Insightful analytics visualizations with actionable recommendations
- Advanced AI assistant with personalized career guidance
- Enhanced fan experience with discovery features

## Technical Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps (2-4 Weeks)
1. **Database Schema**: Define and implement the core data models for users, artists, and analytics
2. **Authentication Flow**: Complete the authentication system with JWT, email verification, and role-based access
3. **API Security**: Implement middleware for protecting routes based on user roles
4. **Frontend Enhancement**: Develop the profile editing interface and analytics visualization components
5. **Integration Planning**: Design the architecture for external platform integrations

### Short-Term Goals (1-3 Months)
1. **External Integrations**: Implement OAuth connections to Spotify, YouTube, and other platforms
2. **Analytics Processing**: Build data aggregation and processing pipeline for cross-platform insights
3. **AI Assistant Enhancement**: Expand AI capabilities with music industry-specific knowledge
4. **Feedback System**: Implement mechanisms for collecting user feedback within the platform
5. **Testing Framework**: Establish comprehensive testing coverage for critical components

### Medium-Term Goals (3-6 Months)
1. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement trend analysis and predictive features
2. **Enhanced Security**: Add 2FA and advanced security measures
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching strategies and optimize database queries
4. **Feature Expansion**: Add complementary features based on user feedback
5. **Scalability Preparation**: Prepare architecture for increased user load

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Frontend (Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- Server-side rendering for optimal SEO and performance
- Responsive, mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience
- Component-based architecture for reusability and maintenance

### Backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
- RESTful API design with appropriate versioning
- Modular service architecture for future scalability
- TypeScript for consistent typing across frontend and backend
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- Relational structure for core entities and relationships
- JSON columns for flexible schema needs (especially analytics)
- Proper indexing and performance optimization
- Regular backup and recovery procedures

### AI Integration (OpenAI API)
- Secure server-side integration with OpenAI
- Context-aware prompting based on user data
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Feedback collection for prompt improvement

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- Vercel for frontend hosting and CDN
- Containerized backend deployable to various cloud providers
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Monitoring and alerting for system health

## Role-Based Access Control

The platform supports four distinct user roles with appropriate permissions:

- **Artists**: Can manage their profiles, view their analytics, and use the AI assistant
- **Fans**: Can view public artist profiles and follow favorites
- **Moderators**: Can review and manage content across the platform
- **Administrators**: Have full access to all system features and settings

## Monitoring and Analytics

We're implementing two layers of analytics:

1. **For Artists**: Platform-aggregated analytics about their content performance
2. **For Product Team**: Usage metrics to understand platform engagement and guide development

## Conclusion and Vision

Not a Label aims to democratize the music industry by providing independent artists with the tools, insights, and guidance previously available only to signed artists. By starting with a Walking Skeleton and following the Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable approach, we'll iteratively build a platform that truly serves artist needs while maintaining the technical foundation for long-term success.

Our long-term vision extends beyond the MVP to create an ecosystem where independent artists can not only analyze their performance but also monetize their work, connect directly with fans, and access resources for sustainable career growth - all without sacrificing creative control or revenue to traditional labels.
